# odin-recipies

There are many reasons to build a recipe website. Maybe you have a passion for cooking and want to share your recipes with the world. Maybe you want to build a business around your cooking skills. Or maybe you just want to have a place to store all your favorite recipes in one place. Whatever your reason, I decided to create a recipe website because it is a great way to share your love of food with others.
